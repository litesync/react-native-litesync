# react-native-octodb

OctoDB Native Plugin for React Native (Android and iOS)

This is a fork of [react-native-sqlite-storage](https://github.com/andpor/react-native-sqlite-storage)

Main differences:

* Links to the OctoDB native library
* Query parameters are not only strings

Features:

  1. iOS and Android supported via identical JavaScript API
  2. Android in pure Java and Native modes
  3. SQL transactions
  4. JavaScript interface via plain callbacks or Promises
  5. Pre-populated SQLite database import from application bundle and sandbox (for dbs that do not use OctoDB)

There are sample apps provided in test directory that can be used in with the AwesomeProject generated by React Native. All you have to do is to copy one of those files into your AwesomeProject replacing index.ios.js

The library has been tested with React 16.2 (and earlier) and XCode 7,8,9 - it works fine out of the box without any need for tweaks or code changes. For XCode 7,8 vs. XCode 6 the only difference is that sqlite ios library name suffix is tbd instead of dylib

# Installation

```
npm install --save react-native-octodb
```

Then follow the instructions for your platform to link `react-native-octodb` into your project

## Promises

To enable promises, run:

```javascript
SQLite.enablePromise(true);
```

## iOS

### React Native 0.60 and above

Run `cd ios && pod install && cd ..`

(linking is not required in React Native 0.60 and above)

### React Native 0.59 and below

#### Step 1. Install Dependencies

##### With CocoaPods:

Add this to your Podfile which should be located inside the ios project subdirectory
```ruby
pod 'React', :path => '../node_modules/react-native'
pod 'react-native-octodb', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-octodb'
```
Or use the sample Podfile included in the package by copying it over to ios subdirectory and replacing AwesomeProject inside of it with the name of your RN project.

Refresh the Pods installation
```ruby
pod install
```
OR
```ruby
pod update
```

Done, skip to Step 2.

##### Without CocoaPods:

This command should be executed in the root directory of your RN project
```shell
react-native link
```

rnpm and xcode are dependencies of this project and should get installed with the module but in case there are issue running rnpm link and rnpm/xcode are not already installed you can try to install it globally as follows:
```shell
npm -g install rnpm xcode
```
After linking project should like this:

![alt tag](instructions/after-rnpm.png)

#### Step 1a. If rnpm link does not work for you you can try manually linking according to the instructions below:


##### Drag the SQLite Xcode project as a dependency project into your React Native XCode project

![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/andpor/react-native-sqlite-storage/master/instructions/libs.png)

##### XCode SQLite libraries dependency set up

Add libSQLite.a (from Workspace location) to the required Libraries and Frameworks. Also add sqlite3.0.tbd (XCode 7) or libsqlite3.0.dylib (XCode 6 and earlier) in the same fashion using Required Libraries view (Do not just add them manually as the build paths will not be properly set)

![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/andpor/react-native-sqlite-storage/master/instructions/addlibs.png)

#### Step 2. Application JavaScript require

Add `var SQLite = require('react-native-octodb')` to your index.ios.js

![alt tag](instructions/require.png)

#### Step 3. Write application JavaScript code using the SQLite plugin

Add JS application code to use SQLite API in your index.ios.js etc. Here is some sample code. For full working example see test/index.ios.callback.js. Please note that Promise based API is now supported as well with full examples in the working React Native app under test/index.ios.promise.js

```javascript
errorCB(err) {
  console.log("SQL Error: " + err);
},

successCB() {
  console.log("SQL executed fine");
},

openCB() {
  console.log("Database OPENED");
},

var db = SQLite.openDatabase("test.db", "1.0", "Test Database", 200000, openCB, errorCB);
db.transaction((tx) => {
  tx.executeSql('SELECT * FROM Employees a, Departments b WHERE a.department = b.department_id', [], (tx, results) => {
      console.log("Query completed");

      // Get rows with Web SQL Database spec compliance.

      var len = results.rows.length;
      for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        let row = results.rows.item(i);
        console.log(`Employee name: ${row.name}, Dept Name: ${row.deptName}`);
      }

      // Alternatively, you can use the non-standard raw method.

      /*
        let rows = results.rows.raw(); // shallow copy of rows Array

        rows.map(row => console.log(`Employee name: ${row.name}, Dept Name: ${row.deptName}`));
      */
    });
});
```

# How to use (Android)

### React Native 0.60 and above

There are no extra steps

### React Native 0.59 and below

#### Step 1 - Update Gradle Settings

Located under Gradle Settings in Project Panel

```gradle
// file: android/settings.gradle
...

include ':react-native-octodb'
project(':react-native-octodb').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-octodb/platforms/android') // react-native-octodb >= 4.0.0
// IMPORTANT: if you are working with a version less than 4.0.0 the project directory is '../node_modules/react-native-octodb/src/android'
```

#### Step 2 - Update app module Gradle Build script

Located under Gradle Settings in Project Panel

```gradle
// file: android/app/build.gradle
...

dependencies {
    ...
    implementation project(':react-native-octodb')
}
```

#### Step 3 - Register React Package

This should work on React version but if it does not, try the ReactActivity based approach

> Note: for version 3.0.0 and below you would have to pass in the instance of your Activity to the SQLitePluginPackage constructor

```java
...
import org.pgsqlite.SQLitePluginPackage;

public class MainActivity extends Activity implements DefaultHardwareBackBtnHandler {

    private ReactInstanceManager mReactInstanceManager;
    private ReactRootView mReactRootView;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        mReactRootView = new ReactRootView(this);
        mReactInstanceManager = ReactInstanceManager.builder()
                .setApplication(getApplication())
                .setBundleAssetName("index.android.bundle")  // this is dependant on how you name you JS files, example assumes index.android.js
                .setJSMainModuleName("index.android")        // this is dependant on how you name you JS files, example assumes index.android.js
                .addPackage(new MainReactPackage())
                .addPackage(new SQLitePluginPackage())       // register SQLite Plugin here
                .setUseDeveloperSupport(BuildConfig.DEBUG)
                .setInitialLifecycleState(LifecycleState.RESUMED)
                .build();
        mReactRootView.startReactApplication(mReactInstanceManager, "AwesomeProject", null); //change "AwesomeProject" to name of your app
        setContentView(mReactRootView);
    }
...

```

Alternative approach on newer versions of React Native (0.18+)

> **Note:** for version 3.0.0 and below you would have to pass in the instance of your Activity to the SQLitePluginPackage constructor

```java
import org.pgsqlite.SQLitePluginPackage;

public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {
  ......

  /**
   * A list of packages used by the app. If the app uses additional views
   * or modules besides the default ones, add more packages here.
   */
    @Override
    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
      return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
        new SQLitePluginPackage(),   // register SQLite Plugin here
        new MainReactPackage());
    }
}
```

#### Step 4 - Require and use in Javascript

See full examples (callbacks and Promise) in the `test` directory

```js
// file: index.android.js

var React = require('react-native');
var SQLite = require('react-native-octodb')
...
```

## Opening a database

Opening a database is slightly different between iOS and Android. Where as on Android the location of the database file is fixed, there are three choices of where the database file can be located on iOS. The 'location' parameter you provide to `openDatabase` call indicated where you would like the file to be created. This parameter is neglected on Android.

WARNING: the default location on iOS has changed in version 3.0.0 - it is now a no-sync location as mandated by Apple so the release is backward incompatible.


To open a database in default no-sync location (affects iOS *only*)::

```js
SQLite.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'default'}, successcb, errorcb);
```

To specify a different location (affects iOS *only*):

```js
SQLite.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'Library'}, successcb, errorcb);
```

where the `location` option may be set to one of the following choices:

- `default`: `Library/LocalDatabase` subdirectory - *NOT* visible to iTunes and *NOT* backed up by iCloud
- `Library`: `Library` subdirectory - backed up by iCloud, *NOT* visible to iTunes
- `Documents`: `Documents` subdirectory - visible to iTunes and backed up by iCloud
- `Shared`:  app group's shared container - *see next section*

The original webSql style `openDatabase` still works and the location will implicitly default to 'default' option:

```js
SQLite.openDatabase("myDatabase.db", "1.0", "Demo", -1);
```

## Opening a database in an App Group's Shared Container (iOS)

If you have an iOS app extension which needs to share access to the same DB instance as your main app, you must use the shared container of a registered app group.

Assuming you have already set up an app group and turned on the "App Groups" entitlement of both the main app and app extension, setting them to the same app group name, the following extra steps must be taken:

#### Step 1 - supply your app group name in all needed `Info.plist`s

In both `ios/MY_APP_NAME/Info.plist` and `ios/MY_APP_EXT_NAME/Info.plist` (along with any other app extensions you may have), you simply need to add the `AppGroupName` key to the main dictionary with your app group name as the string value:

```xml
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <!-- ... -->
  <key>AppGroupName</key>
  <string>MY_APP_GROUP_NAME</string>
  <!-- ... -->
</dict>
</plist>
```

#### Step 2 - set shared database location

When calling `SQLite.openDatabase` in your React Native code, you need to set the `location` param to `'Shared'`:

```js
SQLite.openDatabase({name: 'my.db', location: 'Shared'}, successcb, errorcb);
```

## Importing a pre-populated database.

This is **NOT** supported if the database uses OctoDB, because the database will be downloaded from the primary node(s) at the first run.

But as this library also supports normal SQLite databases, you can import an existing pre-populated database file into your application. 

On this case follow the instructions at the original repo.


## Attaching another database

Sqlite3 offers the capability to attach another database to an existing database-instance, i.e. for making cross database JOINs available.
This feature allows to SELECT and JOIN tables over multiple databases with only one statement and only one database connection.
To archieve this, you need to open both databases and to call the attach()-method of the destination (or master) -database to the other ones.

```js
let dbMaster, dbSecond;

dbSecond = SQLite.openDatabase({name: 'second'},
  (db) => {
    dbMaster = SQLite.openDatabase({name: 'master'},
      (db) => {
        dbMaster.attach( "second", "second", () => console.log("Database attached successfully"), () => console.log("ERROR"))
      },
      (err) => console.log("Error on opening database 'master'", err)
    );
  },
  (err) => console.log("Error on opening database 'second'", err)
);
```

The first argument of `attach()` is the name of the database, which is used in `SQLite.openDatabase()`. The second argument is the alias, that is used to query on tables of the attached database.

The following statement would select data from the master database and include the "second"-database within a simple SELECT/JOIN-statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM user INNER JOIN second.subscriptions s ON s.user_id = user.id
```

To detach a database, just use the detach()-method:

```js
dbMaster.detach( 'second', successCallback, errorCallback );
```

For sure, their is also Promise-support available for attach() and detach(), as shown in the example-application under the
directory "examples".

# Original Cordova SQLite Bindings from Chris Brody and Davide Bertola
https://github.com/litehelpers/Cordova-sqlite-storage

The issues and limitations for the actual SQLite can be found on this site.

## Issues

1. Android binds all numeric SQL input values to double. This is due to the underlying React Native limitation where only a Numeric type is available on the interface point making it ambiguous to distinguish integers from doubles. Once I figure out the proper way to do this I will update the codebase [(Issue #4141)] (https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/4141).
